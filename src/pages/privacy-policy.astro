					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
						CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: <a href="https://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank" class="text-brand-green hover:underline">https://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
						According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
					</p>
					<ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">

					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
						We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

				<div>
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Fair Information Practices</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
						The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
						In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
						<li>We will notify the users via in-site notification within 1 business day.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
						We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

				<div>
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">CAN SPAM Act</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
						The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
						We collect your email address in order to:
					</p>
